## Editing the theme to suit your preferences
Easy AF. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/Patrick-Batenburg/GoogleChromeThemeCreationGuide) for details. Most of it is just changing RGB values

## Credits
Original theme and images were created by the author of [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/black-amoled-x21-pure-bla/gmojgjlmlhclfdfheokkcjngkbiidkaf) (his name is Asana, I guess?)
